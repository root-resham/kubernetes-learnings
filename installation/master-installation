there are two mode of installation of master
1. Control plain mode(Container based installation) mostly used: every service will run in container
        i. api (port no6443)
       ii. controller
      iii. scheduler
       iv. etcd  (port no.2379)
Note: kubelet and container service should have installed in this mode (this service can not be containerized)
2. Systemd mode:(hardway installation)
3. some organizations run etcd on seprate server & add that info in api conf file for communicate with etcd
